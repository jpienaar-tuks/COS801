This is the main repo for our COS801 project.
Project purpose is to replicate the results of:


*Chalkidis, I., & Androutsopoulos, I. (2017, December). A Deep Learning Approach to Contract Element Extraction. In JURIX (pp. 155-164).*


## Dataset
The dataset itself was not included in this repo due the size of the dataset and constraints 
imposed by Github. The dataset can be found [here:](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/CONTRACTS_ICAIL2017/index.html)

* [Labelled Contracts (used the elements contracts in our work)](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/CONTRACTS_ICAIL2017/datasets/labelled_contracts.tar.gz)
* [Unlabelled Contracts (not used in our reproduction)](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/CONTRACTS_ICAIL2017/datasets/unlabelled_contracts.tar.gz)
* [Dictionaries (used for embeddings)](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/CONTRACTS_ICAIL2017/dictionaries.tar.gz)
